I have created a food delivery type app for a school project.

## Splash Screen ##
This is the first screen that appears when the app is loaded.

## Pre-Login Screen ##
This screen gives you the choice to decide if you want to login or register.

## Login Screen ##
The Login Screen gives you the option to log in via email or google account and others.

## Register Screen ##
If you don't have an account you can always go to the Register Screen and create one, you can also use your google account or others to register.


## Home Screen ##
Once your inside the app if you ever made an order they will appear in this screen, you can see all your past orders. 

## Past Order Screen ##
If you click on of your orders in the home screen then this screen will appear and you can see what you ordered last time in detail.


## Food Categories Screen ##
In this screen you can choose any food category that you want.

## Food List Screen ##
Once you have chosen a food category you can see different type of foods that are within the same category.

## Food Detail Screen ##
This screen appears once you have chosen your desired dish and shows you all the detail about the food. You can choose the desired quantity and add it to the cart.

## Food Order Screen ##
Finally this screen is to be able to finish your order, once you make your order it is written in our firebase database and we save it for future orders.
